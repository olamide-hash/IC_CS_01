# 🔎 Web Vulnerability Scanner

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a Python-based web application security scanner developed during my cybersecurity internship.

The scanner automatically analyzes websites to detect common web vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Learn automated vulnerability scanning
- Understand web security concepts
- Practice Python scripting for cybersecurity
- Implement OWASP Top 10 concepts

---

## 🚀 Features

- Website crawling (link discovery)
- SQL Injection testing
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) testing
- Security header analysis
- Automated reporting

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User inputs a target URL.
2. The crawler collects internal website links.
3. Each page is scanned for:
   - SQL Injection vulnerabilities
   - XSS vulnerabilities
   - Missing security headers
4. Results are compiled into a scan report.
